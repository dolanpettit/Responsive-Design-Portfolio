# Responsive-Design-Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio that resembled the examples in the project homework. This was surprisingly a more difficult task than I had expected at first and because I did not give myself quite enough time I was not quite able to match the examples perfectly. This has been a very humbling experience to the length of time required to create a responsive bootstrap website and the intricaciies of the styles. To start this project I needed to create three seperate .html files and link them together, and to make sure that the active link corresponded to the page that I was currently on. Next, I had to create navbar's for all pages and to ensure the positioning of the links was floated to the right of the navbar. I used mostly bootstrap forms to create the content of each page and to style it with responsive design but also had to implement quite a bit of .css to handle what bootstrap could not. This has also been a great preview of how using google to find solutions and templates of code and extracting that code can be crucial when you've hit a roadblock. The last problem that I had and could not figure out was how to make the footer stick to the bottom on the contact.html and the index.html files.
