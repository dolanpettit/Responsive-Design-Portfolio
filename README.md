# Responsive-Design-Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio that resembled the examples in the project homework. This was surprisingly a more difficult task than I had expected at first and because I did not give myself quite enough time I was not quite able to match the examples perfectly. This has been a very humbling experience to the length of time required to create a responsive bootstrap website and the intricaciies of the styles. To start this project I needed to create three seperate .html files and link them together, and to make sure that the active link corresponded to the page that I was currently on. Next, I had to create navbar's for all pages and to ensure the positioning of the links was floated to the right of the navbar. I used mostly bootstrap forms to create the content of each page and to style it with responsive design but also had to implement quite a bit of .css to handle what bootstrap could not.
